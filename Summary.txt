Here's a summary of the Iris Flower Classification project:

Project Selection: Working on the Iris Flower Classification project, a classic machine learning task involving the classification of iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical attributes.

Dataset Acquisition: You obtained the Iris dataset, which includes data on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species of iris flowers.

Initial Exploration: The dataset was loaded into Python using the pandas library. The dataset comprises 150 entries, each with four feature measurements and a species label.
Goal:Our goal is to create a model capable of classifying each iris instance into the appropriate class based
on four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
