# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the classic machine learning task of classifying iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on physical attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using the Iris dataset, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to accurately categorize each iris flower into its appropriate species.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset includes 150 instances, each with four feature measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a species label. It's a widely used dataset for beginner-level machine learning projects due to its simplicity and ease of understanding.
